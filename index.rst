Planning
.........

Work with your local Field Marketing Manager (FMM) to make a Bootcamp event landing and registration page. FMMs also help with facilities & Locations, Schwag, and Pipeline tracking.

- You should drive attendees to register.
- Supporting materials are on GDrive in the `Technology Bootcamp <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_IfSpggJeFVfjdrVUxkZ25tQVRINHFVMkl4TFpWMG1GUUNhOVhaWnJOZ1gtSkJfa2QzSGc>`_ folder.
- FMM can reserve a marketing cluster (No Images Needed on Cluster).
- If Market Clusters are not available, make a HPOC reservation(s) on https://rx.corp.nutanix.com/ (No Images Needed on Cluster).

Work with your stakeholders (Acct Team/Partner Acct Team/Prospect/Customer) to plan the bootcamp/workshop agenda, and proposed schedule dates.

- You have 20 VDI users per HPOC.
- Budget for extra people to attend at the last moment and expect last minute attrition as well.
- Confirm your dates.
